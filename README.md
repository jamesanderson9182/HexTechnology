* composer
* vagrant / Docker
* require rhubab
* equipment list
* pull list creator
* quote generator
* invoice generator
* contact list
* wish list that does web scraping of prices. Can create a graph of a rise and fall of prices. Notifies us if it reaches a certain level
* It could pull in the feed from the pi cams so one web page for each rather than having to remote into each
* Have a look at https://developers.google.com/vision/barcodes-overview
* https://github.com/LazarSoft/jsqrcode for a very simple bar code scanner that would work for a phone. This would probably be a bit slow for us and we would want an android app that has this integerated into it
